## Hi there, I'm Youssef 👋

I'm a passionate and dynamic Software Engineer specializing in full-stack development, with a flair for creating seamless and efficient web applications. I thrive on working with modern technologies like **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, and I always aim to build solutions that balance intuitive front-end experiences with powerful back-end functionality.

## A little more about me:
- 🔭 Currently working on [Caryey](#), a car dealership web application similar to carfax, cargurus etc...(private repo) but open to show case.
- 🌱 Constantly learning new technologies and fine-tuning my skills in **React**, **Node.js**, and **AWS**
- 👯 Open to collaborating on exciting open-source projects and pushing the boundaries of web development
- 💬 Ask me about web development, CI/CD pipelines, automation, and AWS

I've gained valuable experience working in fast-paced environments, where I have successfully developed **CI/CD pipelines**, automated workflows, and optimized application performance. I'm AWS Certified, which allows me to create scalable and robust cloud solutions, helping teams deliver high-quality applications quickly.

## 💼 Professional Experience:
- **Motorola Solutions**: Built and maintained ReactJS dashboards for monitoring security cameras, integrated with Flask back-ends, and wrote Python scripts for camera data retrieval.
- **Veson Nautical**: Enhanced backend data handling and wrote unit tests for improved code reliability.
- **Hack.Diversity Fellow**: Led the development of a MERN stack application, focusing on full-stack development.
- **Caryey Project**(personal project): Caryey is a full-fledged MERN stack application designed to revolutionize car buying and selling by providing a seamless, high-performance marketplace with advanced search, filtering, and auction capabilities. The platform is engineered with scalability, security, and performance in mind, leveraging MongoDB (NoSQL), AWS services, and optimized front-end and back-end architecture.

🛠️ Full-Stack Technology Stack & Architecture
Caryey follows a modern microservices-oriented MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack with additional AWS cloud infrastructure for high availability and scalability.

🔹 Frontend (React + Tailwind)
React.js + Context API + Redux Toolkit → Handles state management for listings, filters, user authentication, and UI updates.
React Router → Provides client-side navigation for smooth, single-page application (SPA) experience.
Lazy Loading & Code Splitting → Improves performance and initial page load times.
Custom Hooks & Context API → Modularized logic for handling authentication, search filters, and API interactions.
Tailwind CSS + Responsive Design → Ensures a modern UI/UX, optimizing across devices.
Optimized Filtering & Search → Uses URL parameters & Context API for real-time filtering without unnecessary re-renders.
🔹 Backend (Node.js + Express)
Express.js → A fast, lightweight Node.js framework handling API endpoints for cars, users, and transactions.
MongoDB (NoSQL) + Mongoose ODM → Stores structured & semi-structured data efficiently with indexing & aggregation pipelines.
RESTful API + JWT Authentication → Secure authentication and protected routes for users, dealers, and admins.
AWS S3 for Image Storage → Stores and serves car images efficiently with CloudFront caching.
Rate Limiting & Security Best Practices → Prevents brute force attacks & API abuse.
🔹 Database (MongoDB + Mongoose)
MongoDB NoSQL Database → Used for scalable, high-performance data storage.
Schema Design & Indexing:
Optimized car listing schema for fast lookups and queries.
Uses compound indexing for performance boosts.
Aggregation Pipelines → Pre-aggregates car listing data for efficient search & filtering.
🔹 Cloud & DevOps (AWS + CI/CD)
AWS EC2 + S3 + CloudFront:
EC2 for scalable hosting.
S3 + CloudFront for fast, global image distribution.
Docker & Containerization → Deploys microservices with scalability in mind.
CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions + AWS CodeDeploy):
Automated builds, tests, and deployments.
Logging & Monitoring (AWS CloudWatch + PM2):
Tracks API performance & error handling.
📌 Key Features
🔹 Advanced Car Search & Filtering
Dynamic search with multiple filters (price, year, model, fuel type, drivetrain, etc.).
URL-based filtering for SEO & shareable links.
🔹 User Authentication & Authorization
Secure JWT-based authentication for users & dealers.
Role-based access control (Admin, Dealer, Buyer).
🔹 Auctions & Buy Now
Auction system with real-time bidding & expiration timers.
Instant purchase options for non-auction cars.
🔹 Dealer Dashboard
Inventory management (add/edit/delete listings).
Performance analytics & lead tracking.
🔹 Responsive & High-Performance UI
Optimized React components for minimal re-renders.
Lazy loading & dynamic imports to reduce load time.
